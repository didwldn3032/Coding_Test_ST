Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:

![lc-midlist1](./Coding_Test_ST/2주차/lc-midlist1.jpg)

<pre>
<code>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
</code>
</pre>

Example 2:

![lc-midlist2](./Coding_Test_ST/2주차/lc-midlist2.jpg)
<pre>
<code>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
</code>
</pre>

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
